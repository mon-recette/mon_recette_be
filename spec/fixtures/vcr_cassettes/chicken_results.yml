        a large pot or wok, big enough to cook all the chicken, and heat the oil in
        it. Once the oil is hot, add sliced onion and fry them until deep golden brown.
        Then take them out on a plate and set aside.\r\nTo the same pot, add the chopped
        garlic and saut\u00e9 for a minute. Then add the chopped tomatoes and cook
        until tomatoes turn soft. This would take about 5 minutes.\r\nThen return
        the fried onion to the pot and stir. Add ginger paste and saut\u00e9 well.\r\nNow
        add the cumin seeds, half of the coriander seeds and chopped green chillies.
        Give them a quick stir.\r\nNext goes in the spices \u2013 turmeric powder
        and red chilli powder. Saut\u00e9 the spices well for couple of minutes.\r\nAdd
        the chicken pieces to the wok, season it with salt to taste and cook the chicken
        covered on medium-low heat until the chicken is almost cooked through. This
        would take about 15 minutes. Slowly saut\u00e9ing the chicken will enhance
        the flavor, so do not expedite this step by putting it on high heat.\r\nWhen
        the oil separates from the spices, add the beaten yogurt keeping the heat
        on lowest so that the yogurt doesn\u2019t split. Sprinkle the remaining coriander
        seeds and add half of the dried fenugreek leaves. Mix well.\r\nFinally add
        the cream and give a final mix to combine everything well.\r\nSprinkle the
        remaining kasuri methi and garam masala and serve the chicken handi hot with
        naan or rotis.

        minute potato gratin with chicken and bacon greens: a gratin always seems
        more effort and more indulgent than ordinary boiled or roasts, but it doesn''t
        have to take 45mins, it''s nice for a change and you can control the calorie
        content by going with full fat to low fat creme fraiche. (It''s always tastes
        better full fat though obviously!) to serve 4: use 800g of potatoes, finely
        slice and boil in a pan for about 5-8 mins till firmish, not soft. Finely
        slice 3 onions and place in an oven dish with 2 tblsp of olive oil and 100ml
        of chicken stock. Cook till the onions are soft then drain the potatoes and
        pour onto the onions. Season and spoon over cream or creme fraiche till all
        is covered but not swimming. Grate Parmesan over the top then finish under
        the grill till nicely golden. serve with chicken and bacon, peas and spinach.","strMealThumb":"https:\/\/www.themealdb.com\/images\/media\/meals\/qwrtut1468418027.jpg","strTags":null,"strYoutube":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=p3u8eiy3yHI","strIngredient1":"Potatoes","strIngredient2":"Onions","strIngredient3":"Olive

        chicken with rice & peas","strDrinkAlternate":null,"strCategory":"Chicken","strArea":"Jamaican","strInstructions":"To
        make the jerk marinade, combine all the ingredients in a food processor along
        with 1 tsp salt, and blend to a pur\u00e9e. If you\u2019re having trouble
        getting it to blend, just keep turning off the blender, stirring the mixture,
        and trying again. Eventually it will start to blend up \u2013 don\u2019t be
        tempted to add water, as you want a thick paste.\r\n\r\nTaste the jerk mixture
        for seasoning \u2013 it should taste pretty salty, but not unpleasantly, puckering
        salty. You can now throw in more chillies if it\u2019s not spicy enough for
        you. If it tastes too salty and sour, try adding in a bit more brown sugar
        until the mixture tastes well balanced.\r\n\r\nMake a few slashes in the chicken
        thighs and pour the marinade over the meat, rubbing it into all the crevices.
        Cover and leave to marinate overnight in the fridge.\r\n\r\nIf you want to
        barbecue your chicken, get the coals burning 1 hr or so before you\u2019re
        ready to cook. Authentic jerked meats are not exactly grilled as we think
        of grilling, but sort of smoke-grilled. To get a more authentic jerk experience,
        add some wood chips to your barbecue, and cook your chicken over slow, indirect
        heat for 30 mins. To cook in the oven, heat to 180C\/160C fan\/gas 4. Put
        the chicken pieces in a roasting tin with the lime halves and cook for 45
        mins until tender and cooked through.\r\n\r\nWhile the chicken is cooking,
        prepare the rice & peas. Rinse the rice in plenty of cold water, then tip
        it into a large saucepan with all the remaining ingredients except the kidney
        beans. Season with salt, add 300ml cold water and set over a high heat. Once
        the rice begins to boil, turn it down to a medium heat, cover and cook for
        10 mins.\r\n\r\nAdd the beans to the rice, then cover with a lid. Leave off
        the heat for 5 mins until all the liquid is absorbed. Squeeze the roasted
        lime over the chicken and serve with the rice & peas, and some hot sauce if
        you like it really spicy.","strMealThumb":"https:\/\/www.themealdb.com\/images\/media\/meals\/tytyxu1515363282.jpg","strTags":"Chilli,Curry","strYoutube":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=qfchrS2D_v4","strIngredient1":"Chicken
